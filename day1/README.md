<h2 id="day1">--- Day 1: Report Repair ---</h2>
<h3 id="part2">--- Part One ---</h2>
<p>Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your <em>expense report</em> (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn't quite adding up.</p>
<p>Specifically, they need you to <em>find the two entries that sum to <code>2020</code></em> and then multiply those two numbers together.</p>
<p>For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:</p>
<pre><code>1721
979
366
299
675
1456
</code></pre>
<p>In this list, the two entries that sum to <code>2020</code> are <code>1721</code> and <code>299</code>. Multiplying them together produces <code>1721 * 299 = 514579</code>, so the correct answer is <code><em>514579</em></code>.</p>
<p>Of course, your expense report is much larger. <em>Find the two entries that sum to <code>2020</code>; what do you get if you multiply them together?</em></p>

<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>1006176</code>.</p>

<h3 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>The Elves in accounting are thankful for your help; one of them even offers you a starfish coin they had left over from a past vacation. They offer you a second one if you can find <em>three</em> numbers in your expense report that meet the same criteria.</p>
<p>Using the above example again, the three entries that sum to <code>2020</code> are <code>979</code>, <code>366</code>, and <code>675</code>. Multiplying them together produces the answer, <code><em>241861950</em></code>.</p>
<p>In your expense report, <em>what is the product of the three entries that sum to <code>2020</code>?</em></p>
